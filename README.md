# 📚 Semantic Book Recommender

**An intelligent book recommendation system powered by semantic search and NLP.**  
Unlike traditional systems that rely only on keywords or genres, this project understands the deeper meaning behind book descriptions and user preferences to give smarter recommendations.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The project follows **three main phases**:

1. **📊 Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure and distribution of the book dataset.
2. **🧭 Vector Search + Text Classification**: Embedding book content using transformer-based models and performing semantic search to find similar books.
3. **💬 Sentiment & Statement Analysis**: Applying emotional tone and statement-type analysis to provide personalized feedback or suggestions.

Finally, we built a fully interactive interface using **Gradio** for easy and user-friendly recommendations.
