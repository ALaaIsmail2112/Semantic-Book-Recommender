Semantic Book Recommender
📚 A smart book recommendation system powered by semantic search and AI technologies.
🚀 Project Overview
Semantic Book Recommender is an intelligent recommendation engine designed to suggest books based on the semantic similarity of book descriptions, user preferences, and content. Unlike traditional keyword-based recommenders, this system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the meaning behind book texts and deliver highly relevant suggestions.

The project progressed through three main stages:

Data Exploration to understand and prepare the dataset.

Vector Search and Text Classification using semantic embeddings and ML models.

Sentiment and Statement Analysis to further refine recommendations.

The final product offers an interactive user experience powered by Gradio.

🛠 Features
Semantic search: Finds books based on meaning, not just keywords.

Context-aware recommendations: Suggests books that match user interests and reading history.

Multiple filtering options: Genre, author, publication year, and more.

User-friendly interface: Built with Gradio for interactive and easy use.

Scalable architecture: Built to handle large datasets efficiently.

💻 Technologies Used
Python

Natural Language Processing (NLP) with libraries like SpaCy, Transformers, or Sentence-BERT

Vector embeddings and similarity search (e.g., FAISS or Annoy)

LangChain for building advanced language model pipelines

Hugging Face models and APIs for semantic embeddings and text understanding

Gradio for building the interactive user interface

🔍 How It Works
Book data is converted into semantic vector embeddings using pretrained language models.

User queries or preferences are also transformed into vectors.

The system computes similarity scores between user inputs and books using vector similarity (cosine similarity or others).

Sentiment and statement analyses further refine the recommendations.

Top matching books are retrieved and recommended through a Gradio web interface.
